Slides providing an introduction to Breedbase development

Slide content is written in git markdown, hosted here, and on each git push Travis CI runs `reveal-md` to automatically deploy an updated presentation to git pages.

Access the presentations [here](https://bellerbrock.github.io/breedbase-slides/)

All set up according to the [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) blog posts [here](https://martinmurphy.tech/2018/04/using-github-pages-for-presentations/) and [here](https://lacourt.dev/2019/03/12)
